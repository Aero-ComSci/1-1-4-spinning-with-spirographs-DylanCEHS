**Zero Iteration Conditions Vs. Infinite Loop Conditions**

The differences between zero-iteration conditions and infinite loops are that zero-iteration loops do not iterate at all as it will always be a false. However, infinite loops will loop infinitely as it will always be true.


**Zero-Iteration Conditions**

x = 1
while x == 7
	print(“I am awesome!”)

[Nothing will print]

**Infinite Loops**

x = 10
while x ==10
	print(“I am awesome!”)

I am awesome!
I am awesome!
I am awesome!
[Repeats infinitely]

**Step 21**
This flowchart is shown to avoid a zero iteration loop. The flowchart shows that if your answer is equal to “y”, then the algorithm is able to continue, but it isn't, the algorithm breaks. This draws a circle an infinite amount of times only if you always answer yes.
